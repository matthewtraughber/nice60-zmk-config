# Problem: spacebar produces intermittent double spaces due to switch bounce.
#
# The spacebar switch exhibits two distinct bounce events after physical release:
#   1. Primary bounce: 17-23ms after physical release. Absorbed by RELEASE_MS=30
#      via ZMK's integrator debounce — the counter decrements during the bounce
#      and re-accumulates, delaying release detection without a false re-press.
#   2. Secondary bounce: ~40ms after physical````` release (after RELEASE_MS window
#      has closed and release is already reported). Lasts ~26ms physically.
#      Requires PRESS_MS > 26ms to filter — the integrator must not reach the
#      press threshold before the bounce contact breaks.
#
# PRESS_MS=30 eliminates double spaces but adds 30ms of press latency.
# Reducing to 20ms recovers most of the typing feel; may allow occasional
# double spaces if the secondary bounce exceeds 20ms.
# Root cause is likely the stabilizer wire rattling after release.
# Hardware fix (lubing stabilizers) would allow PRESS_MS to be set back to 5ms.
